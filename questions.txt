0.  The largest WORD that can be found ( largest length of the word)
1.  get resource usage
2.  16
3.  Because C requires passing structs by reference in functions, because by value, the size would be too big
4.  So, in the for loop we get each word untill EOF(end of file). YEaaaah, I finally understood. So, in the for loop we get the next character untill EOF.                                           Firstly, we check if the character is alphabetical or apostrophes, then we write this character into a char-array and increase an index (in order to be able to write next character). Check the length of the current word. if (index > length) then go through the rest of the word ( ignore this word)                                             Secondly, we ignore the word, which contains a digit. If the character is digit, go through the rest of the word ( untill \0)              Finally, if the 2 IF-statements dont work, it means the end of the word. if the word from char-array is misspelled, print it.    
5.  To be able to check each character. For example, digits are not allowed.
6.  To ensure characters can't be modified during execution.
